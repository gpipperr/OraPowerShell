-- Where the types of PROCESS may be,
-- - RFS - Remote file server
-- - MRP0 - Detached recovery server process
-- - MR(fg) - Foreground recovery session
-- - ARCH - Archiver process
-- - FGRD
-- - LGWR
-- - RFS(FAL)
-- - RFS(NEXP)
-- - LNS - Network server process
--
-- The process status may be,
-- UNUSED - No active process
-- ALLOCATED - Process is active but not currently connected to a primary database
-- CONNECTED - Network connection established to a primary database
-- ATTACHED - Process is actively attached and communicating to a primary database
-- IDLE - Process is not performing any activities
-- ERROR - Process has failed
-- OPENING - Process is opening the archived redo log
-- CLOSING - Process has completed archival and is closing the archived redo log
-- WRITING - Process is actively writing redo data to the archived redo log
-- RECEIVING - Process is receiving network communication
-- ANNOUNCING - Process is announcing the existence of a potential dependent archived redo log
-- REGISTERING - Process is registering the existence of a completed dependent archived redo log
-- WAIT_FOR_LOG - Process is waiting for the archived redo log to be completed
-- WAIT_FOR_GAP - Process is waiting for the archive gap to be resolved
-- APPLYING_LOG - Process is actively applying the archived redo log to the standby database
--
-- The client process may be,
-- Archival - Foreground (manual) archival process (SQL)
-- ARCH - Background ARCn process
-- LGWR - Background LGWR process
