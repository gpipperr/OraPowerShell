prompt ... Stale Status
prompt ... FRESH     - Materialized view is a read-consistent view of the current state of its masters
prompt ... STALE     - Materialized view is out of date because one or more of its masters has changed. 
prompt ...             If the materialized view was FRESH before it became STALE, 
prompt ...             then it is a read-consistent view of a former state of its masters.
prompt ... UNUSABLE  - Materialized view is not a read-consistent view of its masters from any point in time
prompt ... UNKNOWN   - Oracle Database does not know whether the materialized view is in a read-consistent view 
prompt ...             of its masters from any point in time 
prompt ...             this is the case for materialized views created on prebuilt tables)
prompt ... UNDEFINED - Materialized view has remote masters. The concept of staleness is not defined for such materialized views.
